    <p>Don't have time to make a homemade version of chicken noodle soup? Try this one and you won't regret it!</p>
    <ul>
       <li>1 (3 1/2) pound chicken, cut into 8 pieces</li> 
       <li>4 (16 ounce) cans low-sodium chicken broth</li>
       <li>2 carrots, peeled and thinly sliced</li>
       <li>2 stalks celery, sliced</li>
       <li>½ cup chopped onion</li>
       <li>1 (8 ounce) package dried egg noodles</li>
       <li>½ cup finely chopped fresh parsley</li>
       <li>1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
       <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine chicken and chicken broth in a large, heavy pot over medium-high heat; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover partially, and simmer until chicken is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove chicken with tongs and transfer to a large bowl. Allow chicken and broth to cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Remove skin and bones from cooled chicken and discard. Cut chicken meat into bite-sized pieces. Skim fat off the top of the cooled broth and discard.</li>
        <li>Return chicken broth to a simmer. Add carrots, celery, and onion to the broth and simmer until vegetables soften, about 8 minutes. Stir in chicken, egg noodles, parsley, and lemon juice and simmer until noodles are tender, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
    </ol>
